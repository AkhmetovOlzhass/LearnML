# LearnML
This repository contains my personal Jupyter Notebooks for learning and practicing machine learning concepts. Topics include supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, model evaluation, and more. The notebooks use real-world datasets and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
